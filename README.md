# Anaemia Classification Models

This repository contains three different classification models built using deep learning techniques to predict anaemia based on various features. The models are implemented using Python and popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the models is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains medical data of patients, including their hemoglobin levels and other relevant features. The dataset can be accessed through the following DOI: [10.17632/ccr8cm22vz.1](https://doi.org/10.17632/ccr8cm22vz.1).

## Models

The following three classification models have been implemented:

1. **Vision Transformer (ViT)**
   - Architecture: Vision Transformer
   - Accuracy: 96.87%

2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
   - Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network
   - Accuracy: 96.5%

3. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**
   - Architecture: Recurrent Neural Network
   - Accuracy: 95.3%

## Usage

The models are implemented in a Google Colab notebook, which can be accessed through the following link: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E-PSVxg6gQX43P2yX2Ib9WdIBQHcIojE?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E-PSVxg6gQX43P2yX2Ib9WdIBQHcIojE?usp=sharing)

To use the models, follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Colab notebook.
2. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
3. Run the cells to preprocess the data and train the models.
4. Evaluate the models using the provided test data.
